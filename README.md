# Three-water-jug-problem
A solution to a popular puzzle, but with three jugs. The problem is explained here : https://curiosity.com/topics/try-to-solve-the-tricky-3-jug-riddle-curiosity/
But in this program, I was tasked to create a depth first search algorithm to find all possible states rather than find a solution.
Main.java and State.java contain the source code, or alternatively you can import the Java project provided into an IDE (such as Eclipse). I received 100% for this coursework.
